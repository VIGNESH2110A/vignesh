            <p><b>History Of PiZZA</b></p>
            <p>Pizza is the worlds favourite fast food. We eat it everywhere  at home, in restaurants, on street
                corners. Some three billion pizzas are sold each year in the United States alone,
                an average of 46 slices per person. But the story of how the humble pizza came to enjoy such global
                dominance reveals much about the history of migration, economics and technological change.</p>

            <p>People have been eating pizza, in one form or another, for centuries. As far back as antiquity, pieces of
                flatbread, topped with savouries,
                served as a simple and tasty meal for those who could not afford plates, or who were on the go. These
                early pizzas appear in Virgils Aeneid. Shortly after arriving in Latium, Aeneas and his crew sat down
                beneath a tree and laid out
                thin wheaten cakes as platters for their meal. They then scattered them with mushrooms and herbs they
                had found in the woods and guzzled them down, crust and all, prompting Aeneas son Ascanius to exclaim:
                Look! Weve even eaten our plates!</p>
